# Generic Notification System

Problem Statement 
Most applications have the need to implement notifications for a variety of use cases and scenarios. Create a centralized generic service for notification that can be used by a variety consuming application for their notification needs e.g. an incident workflow system may use this system when each incident ticket moves from one state to another, similarly a order management system may use this service to notify the customer of the status of the order whenever it changes 
 
The system should allow for the following capabilities: 
 
1.	Accept messages including from, to and subject 
2.	Ability to notify on multiple channels (e.g email, slack, you can stub out/mock if required) 
3.	Deliver messages in correct order for each consumer of this  
 
Deliverables 
1.	The code for the service in github with instructions on how to set it up and run it
